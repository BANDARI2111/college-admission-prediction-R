# College Admission Prediction Model

This repository presents a robust data analysis pipeline to predict a student's probability of admission to a graduate program. The project leverages a comprehensive dataset of applicant profiles and compares two regression models‚ÄîLinear Regression and Random Forest‚Äîto determine the most effective predictive approach.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

* **Comprehensive EDA:** In-depth exploratory data analysis reveals key relationships between applicant scores and admission chances.
* **Dual-Model Implementation:** Builds and evaluates both a classic Linear Regression model for interpretability and a powerful Random Forest model for predictive accuracy.
* **Quantitative Evaluation:** Models are rigorously assessed using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE metrics on a dedicated test set.
* **Interactive Application:** Includes a standalone Shiny app (`app.R`) for real-time admission predictions based on user-provided inputs.

## üìà Analysis and Model Performance

The analysis confirms that applicant metrics such as CGPA, GRE Score, and TOEFL Score are strong predictors of admission chance.

### Key Visualizations

| CGPA Distribution | GRE Score vs. Admission Chance | TOEFL Score by Research |

### Model Diagnostics

The plots below compare each model's predicted values against the actual values. The Random Forest model's predictions cluster more tightly around the ideal diagonal line, indicating superior performance.

## üèÜ Final Results & Recommendation

The Random Forest model consistently outperformed Linear Regression, demonstrating a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and a higher R-squared value.

| Model | RMSE | R-squared | MAE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Linear Regression | 0.0632 | 0.8143 | 0.0451 |
| **Random Forest** | **0.0594** | **0.8354** | **0.0415** |

**Conclusion:** Due to its superior predictive accuracy, the **Random Forest model** is the recommended solution for this prediction task.
